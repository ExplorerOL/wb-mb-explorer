# wb-mb-explorer

wb-mb-explorer is a tool for easy scan and configure Wirenboard Modbus devices. It is a pseudographical cover for modbus_client, wb-mcu-fw-flasher and wb-mcu-fw-updater tools.

For using this tool just copy it into your Wirenboard controller, make it executable and start. Configuration is stored in /root/wb-mb-explorer.conf file, log of last session is stored in /root/wb-mb-explorer.conf file. So your Linux user must have write acces to this directory.
